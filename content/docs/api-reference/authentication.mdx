# API Authentication

This guide explains how to authenticate with the Nexlayer API to access protected endpoints.

## API Keys

The Nexlayer API uses API keys for authentication. Each API key is associated with a specific user account and has specific permissions.

### Obtaining an API Key

To obtain an API key:

1. Log in to your Nexlayer account
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Enter a name for your API key (e.g., "Development", "Production")
5. Select the permissions you want to grant to this key
6. Click "Create"

Your API key will be displayed once. Make sure to copy it and store it securely, as you won't be able to view it again.

### API Key Security

API keys should be kept secure:

- Never share your API key publicly
- Don't commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables to store API keys in your applications
- Rotate API keys regularly

## Using API Keys

To authenticate with the Nexlayer API, include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your requests:

\`\`\`
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
\`\`\`

### Example: cURL

\`\`\`bash
curl -X GET "https://app.nexlayer.io/getReservations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
\`\`\`

### Example: JavaScript

```js
fetch('https://app.nexlayer.io/getReservations', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

### Example: Python

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'
}

response = requests.get('https://app.nexlayer.io/getReservations', headers=headers)
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

## Session Tokens

For some operations, particularly those related to deployments, you'll need to use session tokens instead of API keys.

Session tokens are temporary credentials that are generated when you start a deployment. They're included in the response from the `/startUserDeployment` endpoint:

```json
{
  "message": "Deployment started successfully",
  "url": "https://fantastic-fox-my-mern-app.alpha.nexlayer.ai",
  "sessionToken": "token",
  "applicationName": "My Mern App"
}
```
