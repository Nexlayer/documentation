# API Reference Overview

The Nexlayer API allows you to programmatically deploy and manage your applications. This guide provides an overview of the API and how to use it.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://app.nexlayer.io
```

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication. You can authenticate by including your API key in the request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

To obtain an API key, visit the [API Keys](https://app.nexlayer.io/settings/api-keys) page in your Nexlayer dashboard.

## Request Format

The Nexlayer API accepts requests in different formats depending on the endpoint:

- JSON for most endpoints
- YAML for deployment-related endpoints

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. A typical response looks like this:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "example": "Response data here"
  }
}
```

If an error occurs, the response will include an error message:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message here"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The Nexlayer API has rate limits to prevent abuse. The current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 1000 requests per hour per API key

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a 429 Too Many Requests response.

## Common Endpoints

Here are some of the most commonly used API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/startUserDeployment` | POST | Deploy an application |
| `/feedback` | POST | Send feedback to Nexlayer |
| `/extendDeployment` | POST | Extend a deployment's lifetime |
| `/claimDeployment` | POST | Claim a deployment |
| `/schema` | GET | Get the YAML schema |
| `/validate` | POST | Validate a YAML file |

For detailed information about each endpoint, including request and response formats, see the [API Reference](/api-reference) section.

## Example: Deploying an Application

Here's an example of how to deploy an application using the API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://app.nexlayer.io/startUserDeployment" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/x-yaml" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --data-binary @nexlayer.yaml
```

## Error Handling

When using the API, it's important to handle errors properly. Always check the `success` field in the response to determine if the request was successful.

If an error occurs, the `error` field will contain a description of what went wrong. Use this information to troubleshoot and fix the issue.
