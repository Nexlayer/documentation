# Nexlayer CLI

The Nexlayer Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that allows you to deploy, manage, and monitor your applications directly from your terminal.

## Installation

Install the Nexlayer CLI using npm:

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g @nexlayer/cli
\`\`\`

Or using yarn:

\`\`\`bash
yarn global add @nexlayer/cli
\`\`\`

## Authentication

Before using the CLI, you need to authenticate:

\`\`\`bash
nexlayer login
\`\`\`

This will open a browser window where you can log in to your Nexlayer account.

## Basic Commands

### Deploy an Application

Deploy your application using a YAML configuration file:

\`\`\`bash
nexlayer deploy -f nexlayer.yaml
\`\`\`

### List Deployments

View all your current deployments:

\`\`\`bash
nexlayer list
\`\`\`

### Get Deployment Status

Check the status of a specific deployment:

\`\`\`bash
nexlayer status [deployment-id]
\`\`\`

### Delete a Deployment

Remove a deployment:

\`\`\`bash
nexlayer delete [deployment-id]
\`\`\`

## Configuration Reference

The Nexlayer CLI uses YAML files for configuration. See the [Configuration Reference](/docs/configuration/yaml-reference) for detailed information on how to structure your configuration files.

## Environment Variables

You can use environment variables in your configuration files:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: my-app
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: ${DATABASE_URL}
    API_KEY: ${API_KEY}
\`\`\`

Then, you can provide these variables when deploying:

\`\`\`bash
nexlayer deploy -f nexlayer.yaml --env-file .env
\`\`\`
