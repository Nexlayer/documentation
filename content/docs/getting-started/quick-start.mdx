# Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying your first application to Nexlayer. You'll have a live application in just a few minutes!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Nexlayer account (sign up at [nexlayer.io](https://nexlayer.io) if you don't have one)
- Docker installed on your local machine
- Your application code ready to deploy

## Step 1: Create a Nexlayer YAML File

Create a file named `nexlayer.yaml` in the root of your project with the following content:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: "my-first-app"
  pods:
    - name: "web"
      image: "nginx:latest"  # Replace with your own image
      servicePorts:
        - 80
\`\`\`

This simple configuration will deploy a single container running Nginx.

## Step 2: Deploy Your Application

You have several options for deploying your application:

### Option 1: Use the Nexlayer CLI

\`\`\`bash
# Install the Nexlayer CLI
curl -sSL https://get.nexlayer.io | bash

# Deploy your application
nexlayer deploy
\`\`\`

### Option 2: Use the Web Interface

1. Go to [app.nexlayer.io](https://app.nexlayer.io)
2. Click on "New Deployment"
3. Upload your `nexlayer.yaml` file
4. Click "Deploy"

### Option 3: Use the API

\`\`\`bash
curl -X POST "https://app.nexlayer.io/startUserDeployment" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/x-yaml" \
  --data-binary @nexlayer.yaml
\`\`\`

## Step 3: Access Your Application

Once your application is deployed, you'll receive a URL where you can access it. This typically takes less than a minute.

## Next Steps

Now that you've deployed your first application, you might want to:

- [Configure custom domains](/docs/custom-domains)
- [Set up environment variables](/docs/environment-variables)
- [Add persistent storage](/docs/persistent-storage)
- [Configure auto-scaling](/docs/auto-scaling)

Congratulations on deploying your first application with Nexlayer!
