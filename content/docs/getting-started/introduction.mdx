# Introduction to Nexlayer

Nexlayer is an AI-powered cloud platform that simplifies deploying and scaling applications. With Nexlayer, you define your application structure in a simple YAML file, and our platform handles all the complex infrastructure details automatically.

## Key Features

- **Zero DevOps**: Focus on your code, not infrastructure
- **AI-Optimized**: Built specifically for AI and ML workloads
- **Instant Deployment**: Go from code to production in seconds
- **Automatic Scaling**: Handle traffic spikes without manual intervention
- **Cost Efficient**: Pay only for what you use

## How It Works

Nexlayer uses a declarative approach to deployment. You describe what you want your application to look like, and our AI figures out how to make it happen.

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: "my-ai-app"
  pods:
    - name: "web"
      image: "user-name/web:latest"
      servicePorts:
        - 3000
\`\`\`

This simple YAML file is all you need to deploy a web application to Nexlayer. Our platform will:

1. Provision the necessary infrastructure
2. Pull your container image
3. Configure networking
4. Set up monitoring and logging
5. Provide you with a URL to access your application
