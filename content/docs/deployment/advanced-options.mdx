# Advanced Deployment Options

Nexlayer provides several advanced deployment options to give you fine-grained control over your applications.

## Resource Allocation

You can specify CPU and memory resources for each component of your application:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: my-app
  components:
    - name: api
      resources:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 2Gi
    - name: worker
      resources:
        cpu: 2
        memory: 4Gi
\`\`\`

## Scaling

Configure auto-scaling for your components based on CPU or memory usage:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: my-app
  components:
    - name: api
      scaling:
        min: 2
        max: 10
        metrics:
          - type: cpu
            target: 80
\`\`\`

## Health Checks

Define health checks to ensure your application is running correctly:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: my-app
  components:
    - name: api
      healthCheck:
        path: /health
        port: 3000
        initialDelaySeconds: 30
        periodSeconds: 10
\`\`\`

## Custom Domains

Add custom domains to your application:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: my-app
  domains:
    - api.example.com
    - www.example.com
\`\`\`

## Environment-specific Configurations

Use different configurations for different environments:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: my-app
  environments:
    production:
      components:
        - name: api
          scaling:
            min: 3
            max: 20
    staging:
      components:
        - name: api
          scaling:
            min: 1
            max: 5
\`\`\`

## Secrets Management

Securely manage sensitive information:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: my-app
  secrets:
    - name: DATABASE_URL
      value: ${DATABASE_URL}
    - name: API_KEY
      value: ${API_KEY}
\`\`\`

## Deployment Strategies

Configure how updates are rolled out:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: my-app
  deploymentStrategy:
    type: rolling
    maxUnavailable: 25%
    maxSurge: 25%
\`\`\`

## Network Policies

Define network policies to control traffic between components:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: my-app
  networkPolicies:
    - name: api-to-db
      from:
        - component: api
      to:
        - component: database
      ports:
        - 5432
\`\`\`

## Persistent Storage

Configure persistent storage for your components:

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: my-app
  components:
    - name: database
      storage:
        - name: data
          size: 10Gi
          mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
\`\`\`
