# YAML Configuration

Nexlayer uses YAML files to define your application's structure and behavior. This guide will help you understand how to write effective YAML configurations for your applications.

## Basic Structure

Every Nexlayer YAML file starts with an `application` block that defines your application:

```yaml
application:
  name: "my-application"
  # Additional configuration goes here
```

## Defining Pods

Pods are the core of your application. Each pod represents a container that runs your code.

Below is a table describing the properties you can set for each pod:

```yaml
application:
  name: "my-application"
  pods:
    - name: "web"
      image: "nginx:latest"
      servicePorts:
        - 80
```

## Environment Variables

You can define environment variables for your pods:

```yaml
application:
  name: "my-application"
  pods:
    - name: "web"
      image: "my-image:latest"
      env:
        - name: "DATABASE_URL"
          value: "postgres://user:password@host:port/db"
        - name: "API_KEY"
          value: "my-api-key"
```

## Resource Allocation

You can specify CPU and memory resources for your pods:

```yaml
application:
  name: "my-application"
  pods:
    - name: "web"
      image: "my-image:latest"
      resources:
        cpu: 1
        memory: "512Mi"
```

## Advanced Configuration

For more advanced configuration options, check out our [Advanced Deployment Options](/docs/deployment/advanced-options) guide.

## Example: Full Application

Here's an example of a complete application with multiple pods:

```yaml
application:
  name: "my-full-app"
  pods:
    - name: "web"
      image: "my-web-image:latest"
      servicePorts:
        - 80
      env:
        - name: "API_URL"
          value: "http://api:3000"
      resources:
        cpu: 0.5
        memory: "256Mi"
    
    - name: "api"
      image: "my-api-image:latest"
      servicePorts:
        - 3000
      env:
        - name: "DATABASE_URL"
          value: "postgres://user:password@db:5432/mydb"
      resources:
        cpu: 1
        memory: "512Mi"
    
    - name: "db"
      image: "postgres:13"
      servicePorts:
        - 5432
      env:
        - name: "POSTGRES_USER"
          value: "user"
        - name: "POSTGRES_PASSWORD"
          value: "password"
        - name: "POSTGRES_DB"
          value: "mydb"
      resources:
        cpu: 1
        memory: "1Gi"
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how to configure your applications with YAML, you're ready to deploy! Check out our [CLI documentation](/docs/cli/overview) to learn how to use our command-line tools to deploy your applications.
