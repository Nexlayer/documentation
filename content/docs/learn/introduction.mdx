# Learning Nexlayer

Welcome to the Nexlayer learning center. This guide will help you understand how Nexlayer works and how to use it effectively for your applications.

## What is Nexlayer?

Nexlayer is an AI-powered cloud platform that simplifies deploying and scaling applications. With Nexlayer, you define your application structure in a simple YAML file, and our platform handles all the complex infrastructure details automatically.

## How Nexlayer Works

Nexlayer uses a declarative approach to deployment. You describe what you want your application to look like, and our AI figures out how to make it happen.

\`\`\`yaml
application:
  name: "my-ai-app"
  pods:
    - name: "web"
      image: "user-name/web:latest"
      servicePorts:
        - 3000
\`\`\`

This simple YAML file is all you need to deploy a web application to Nexlayer. Our platform will:

1. Provision the necessary infrastructure
2. Pull your container image
3. Configure networking
4. Set up monitoring and logging
5. Provide you with a URL to access your application

## Key Concepts

### Pods

Pods are the smallest deployable units in Nexlayer. Each pod represents a container that runs your application code.

### Services

Services define how your pods are exposed to the internet or to other pods within your application.

### Volumes

Volumes provide persistent storage for your applications, ensuring that your data remains available even if pods are restarted.
