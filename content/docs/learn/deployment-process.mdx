# Deployment Process

This guide explains how Nexlayer deploys your applications, from the moment you submit your YAML file to when your application is up and running.

## Overview

The Nexlayer deployment process consists of several steps:

1. **YAML Validation**: Your configuration file is validated to ensure it's correctly formatted
2. **Resource Allocation**: Nexlayer allocates the necessary resources for your application
3. **Container Deployment**: Your containers are deployed to the Nexlayer infrastructure
4. **Network Configuration**: Networking is set up to connect your pods and expose services
5. **Health Checks**: Nexlayer verifies that your application is running correctly
6. **URL Assignment**: Your application is assigned a URL for access

## Step 1: YAML Validation

When you submit your YAML file, Nexlayer first validates it to ensure:

- The syntax is correct
- All required fields are present
- The configuration is logically consistent
- Resource requests are within your account limits

If any issues are found, Nexlayer will provide detailed error messages to help you fix them.

## Step 2: Resource Allocation

Once your YAML is validated, Nexlayer allocates the necessary resources for your application:

- Compute resources (CPU, memory)
- Storage resources (if persistent volumes are requested)
- Network resources

Nexlayer's AI optimizes resource allocation to ensure your application runs efficiently while minimizing costs.

## Step 3: Container Deployment

Next, Nexlayer pulls the container images specified in your YAML file and deploys them to the infrastructure:

- Images are pulled from the specified registry
- Containers are created with the specified configuration
- Environment variables are injected
- Volume mounts are set up (if specified)

## Step 4: Network Configuration

Nexlayer sets up networking for your application:

- Internal networking between pods
- External access for services that need to be publicly available
- Load balancing for services with multiple replicas
- DNS configuration for service discovery

## Step 5: Health Checks

Once your application is deployed, Nexlayer performs health checks to ensure it's running correctly:

- HTTP health checks for web services
- TCP health checks for other services
- Custom health checks (if specified)

If any health checks fail, Nexlayer will attempt to restart the affected pods and notify you of the issue.

## Step 6: URL Assignment

Finally, Nexlayer assigns a URL to your application:

- Each application gets a unique subdomain on the nexlayer.ai domain
- Custom domains can be configured (if specified)
- SSL certificates are automatically provisioned for secure access

## Monitoring Your Deployment

You can monitor the status of your deployment through:

- The Nexlayer dashboard
- The Nexlayer CLI
- Deployment logs
